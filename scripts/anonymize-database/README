To create an anonymized database dump, untar a dump from the backups in the
current directory, following the naming convention: c2corg.YYYY-MM-DD.dump.
Then run:
  docker-compose build
  docker-compose up
wait until the scripts finish running, then hit CTRL-C and cleanup with:
  docker-compose down
The generated anonymised dump can be found in the current directory, named:
c2corg-anonymized.dump
